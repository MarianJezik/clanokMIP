        abstract = {This review is designed to inform practitioners, policy developers and other stakeholders who want to reflect more deeply upon their practice or gain a greater understanding about how theory and practice can be mapped together. It is argued that reforming practice requires transformations of understanding of principles that are assumed {\textendash} sometimes implicitly {\textendash} in the practices. This review offers a framework for understanding where a particular implementation of e-learning is positioned in the complex current landscape of technology-enhanced teaching in UK HE/FE. It does so by attempting to offer a set of questions to be posed of an e-learning development {\textendash} the answers to which reveal the underlying pedagogic and pragmatic assumptions.}
